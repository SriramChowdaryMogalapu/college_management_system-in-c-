# College_management_system-in-cpp
This project allows you to add, delete, edit, and display the records of students in the college. The project is written in C++.

Through this project, we can maintain the student records in a file. I have written this file in C++ and I have made this user-friendly.

You can add a student through 1st choice add and then it asks for student details after entering them it saves them in the College.txt file. 

You can ask the system to display all student records through 2nd option. Using 3rd option you can delete the student details from the file. 

Through 4th and 5th options we can edit and search the student details in the details.
